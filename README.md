# What is DIARDE on Android? 

DIARDE on Android is the native Android app to offer the DIARDE service to users using an Android-powered mobile device. The functionality offered at the moment is almost equivalent to the generic web app DIARDEMobile. The user can register, login, create new projects and rooms and take and upload new photos. After the photos were processed the user can revisit the project at an time and view the generated 3-D model and the room layout as well as request SketchUp and AutoCAD files.

# Getting started

DIARDE on Android is a native Android app developed in Kotlin. To use and test the app you should have Android-Studio installed.
Opening the project in AndroidStudio and running it in either debug or production mode should work on physical and virtual 
devices with Android API version 24 or higher. If you encounter an issue, please let us know studiocinqo@gmail.com
